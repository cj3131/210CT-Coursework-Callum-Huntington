"""
Adapt the binary search algorithm so that instead of outputting whether
a specific value was found, it outputs whether a value within an
interval (specified by you) was found.
Write the pseudocode and code and give the time complexity of the
algorithm using the Big O notation.
Example input:  L = [2,3,5,7,9,13]   low= 10   high = 14   Output: True

Pseudocode:

def BINARY_SEARCH(list, lowerBound, upperBound):
    while listStart <= listEnd and found = False:
        listMiddle <-- (listStart + listEnd) / 2
        if list[listMiddle] >= lowerBound or list[listMiddle] <= upperBound:
            found 

Time complexity of O(log(n)) since the list is constantly being made half it's previous size with each iteration.
